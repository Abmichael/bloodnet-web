# BloodNet Authentication Workflow - Testing Checklist

## ‚úÖ FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Signup & Apply Pages Now Working
- **Issue**: Pages were rendering as empty due to incorrect routing structure
- **Fix**: Updated App.tsx to render standalone pages instead of wrapping in MainLayout
- **Test**: 
  - Navigate to `/signup` - Should show donor registration form
  - Navigate to `/apply` - Should show organization application form

### 2. Sidebar Admin Dropdown Now Working  
- **Issue**: Admin dropdown menu wasn't expanding due to missing StyleClass ref
- **Fix**: Added `adminMenuRef` and updated StyleClass logic to handle Admin menu
- **Test**: 
  - Login as admin user 
  - Check sidebar for "Admin" menu item
  - Click to expand and see "Applications" submenu

## üß™ MANUAL TESTING WORKFLOW

### A. Donor Registration Flow
1. **Signup Process**:
   - Go to `/signup`
   - Fill out donor registration form
   - Submit and verify redirect to dashboard
   - Should prompt for profile completion

2. **Profile Completion**:
   - After signup, should see profile completion prompt
   - Navigate to donors section
   - Create donor profile
   - Verify profile completion status updates

### C. Authentication Guards
1. **Approval Status Checking**:
   - Test that pending users cannot access main application
   - Test that rejected users see appropriate messaging
   - Test that approved users can access all features

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Test that admin routes are protected
   - Test that non-admin users cannot access admin features
   - Test that role-based components render correctly

## üöÄ READY FOR BACKEND INTEGRATION

All frontend components are implemented and ready for:
- API endpoint integration
- Database connection
- Email notification system
- Production deployment

## üêõ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Backend API**: Currently using mock hooks - needs real API integration
2. **Email Notifications**: Infrastructure ready but not implemented
3. **File Uploads**: Organization documents/certificates not implemented
4. **Advanced Validation**: Basic validation in place, could be enhanced

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. **Backend Development**: Implement corresponding API endpoints
2. **Testing**: Add unit tests for authentication components
3. **Error Handling**: Enhance error boundaries and user feedback
4. **Performance**: Add loading states and optimization
5. **Security**: Implement proper JWT handling and refresh tokens
